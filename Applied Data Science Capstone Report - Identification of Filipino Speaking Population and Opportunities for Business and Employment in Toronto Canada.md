<h1> Applied Data Science Capstone Report - Identification of Filipino Speaking Population and Opportunities for Business and Employment in Toronto Canada

<h2>Introduction

Filipino Canadians are Canadians of Filipino descent or people born in the Philippines who are citizens of Canada. Filipino Canadians are the third largest subgroup of the overseas Filipinos and one of the fastest growing groups in Canada.

Most Canadians of Filipino origin can converse in one of Canada's official languages. In 2001, 99% said they could converse in one or both official languages, while 1% reported they could speak neither English nor French. Most, 93%, could carry on a conversation in English only, while 6% could converse in both English and French and below 1% spoke French only. In 2001, 59% of the Filipino community said that their mother tongue was a non-official language, while 41% said that their mother tongue was English and 1% said that it was French. 60% of the Filipino community considered Tagalog their mother tongue.

<h2>Business Situation

As a Filipino who would like to start a business in Toronto, the planning, execution, and maintenance depends on the demographics of the population that the business may mainly cater to.

Canadian adults of Filipino origin are more likely than the rest of the population to have a university degree. In 2001, 31% of Canadians of Filipino origin aged 15 and over had either a bachelor or post-graduate degree. Canadians of Filipino origin with post-secondary qualifications are more likely to hold degrees in highly technical fields. In 2001, people of Filipino origin accounted for 2% of university graduates in Canada. In 2001, studies show that 33% of women of Filipino origin had a university degree, compared to 27% of their male counterparts. 

As such, identifying a location to establish a business that is best suited to cater to the growing Filipino Canadian population in Toronto as a clientele and, at the same time, create employment opportunities for Filipinos may be a consideration when planning to build a business in the area.

<h2> Foursquare and Language in Business Solution

Using Foursquare, identification of the location that have the largest population of Filipinos and identifying the industries present in the said location may be useful in planning the kind of business to introduce in the area. The business would ideally be useful for the present industries and provide a means for the business to start small and grow in the community.

<h2> The Utility of Data Science in Locating Business Potential thru Language


Toronto was evaluated by population size per neighborhood, average income per neighborhood, and languages spoken per neighborhood using data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:M , and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Toronto_neighbourhoods along with Beautifulsoup and pickle, geocoder was used to determine characteristics by longitude and latitude, and economic characteristics of the population, as well as the types of businesses in the area were identified.

The following steps were undertaken:
    1. Toronto was evaluated by population size per neighborhood, average income per neighborhood, and languages spoken per neighborhood.
    2. Neighborhoods that have Filipino speaking population were isolated and the areas with the most number of Filipino speaking population was selected..
    3. The neighborhoods were evaluated by income type to determine the need for a Filipino community supporting business.
    4. The income of the Filipinos in Toronto were also evaluated to determine the type of business that can cater to the financial capacity of Filipinos.
    5. The most common and least common businesses in the area were identified.
    6. The topography of the venues with respect to each other were visualized.
    7. The number of food places that may serve Filipino food or may utilize Filipino food-related goods were identified.

<h2> Conclusion after Review of Business Types and Volume of Businesses

There are many restaurants and dining places. There is no "Filipino Restaurant" in the registry, but "Seafood Restaurant", "Molecular Gastronomy Restaurant", "Restaurant", "Gastropub", "Comfort Food Restaurant", "Food Truck", and "Diner" may serve Filipino food.


There is only one grocery store, which may be sufficient to cover the area.

A good type of business to introduce in the area that can be put up by and may cater to Filipinos is a supplier type of business for restaurants and grocery stores who would like to serve Filipino food in their menu.

A web-based and/or app-based registry for foodies, critiques, or bloggers to identify the presence of Filipino food that will identify food types served in relatively ambiguous-named dining locations such as "Seafood Restaurant", "Molecular Gastronomy Restaurant", "Restaurant", "Gastropub", "Comfort Food Restaurant", "Food Truck", and "Dinerâ€œ, may also be a good venture.

A Filipino food guide registry is a good way of connecting food places and such type of business as a "food guide/ review" fod cities may consolidate the information and may be used as a city or neighborhood guide for people who visit the area and to improve tourism by way of diversity.
